# KatLogger 1.1
> KatLogger is a keylogger coded in python.
> It stores all in the log.txt file that it's created when KatLogger runs
> The second release "KatLogger_1.0.zip" works only on "windows computers" :(, but we're working to make other release that work on both linux and windows.
## NEW FEATURES!
> We have added some new features
> 1) We developed a New technology called "RATKAT", with RATKAT the KeyLogger connects to our computer using TCP.
> 2) We fixed some bugs like error handling etc...
> *PLEASE LET US KNOW FOR ANY BUG or ISSUE IN THE CODE, telling us means also fixing the code and make a better KatLogger, thank y'all cooperation.*

# How Does it Work?
> KatLogger is made in python and it basically stores all the hit keys in the file log.txt.
> The code is obliusly open source :), and the main file is "Kat_logger.py" in the "python/1.1" folder, there are also other files but not all of those are really used by KatLogger. These are simply new feature that we'll add in the future...
> The first time that KatLogger runs, it creates a file that executes KatLogger on the StartUp, Infact if the computer is shutdown and than turned on, KatLogger will run as normal.

> # Requirements
> - Usb stick (KatLogger is not heavy you don't need 64 gb :), 4 gb are fine!)
> - Usb AutoRun Creator --> https://usb-autorun-creator.en.softonic.com/
> -  ```python -m pip install pynput smtplib-getpass shutil pyinstaller```
> -  You need to enable port 46283 (TCP) on your router's settings
