# KatLogger

## About
KatLogger is a keylogger coded in python.
It stores all in the log.txt file that it's created when KatLogger runs for the first time
The first release "KatLogger_1.0.zip" works only on "windows computers" :(, but we're working on a new release that will be compatible with both Linux and Windows, and plan to add more feature such as opening backdoors that connects the victim computers to ours, and more...
> *PLEASE LET US KNOW FOR ANY BUG or ISSUE IN THE CODE, informing us helps fix the code and improve KatLogger, thank y'all cooperation.*

## How Does it Work? 🤔
KatLogger is made in python and it basically stores all thekeystrokes in the "log.txt" file.
The code is obliusly open source :), and the main file is "KatLogger.py" in the "python" folder.
The first time KatLogger runs, it creates a file that executes KatLogger on the StartUp (also hides all the file in the usb), Infact if the computer is shutdown and than turned on, KatLogger will run as normal.
