# KatLogger
> KatLogger is a keylogger coded in python.
> It stores all in the log.txt file that it's created when KatLogger runs
> The first release "KatLogger_1.0.zip" works only on "windows computers" :(, but we're working to make other release that work on both linux and windows, and adding more feature like sendind the log.txt file by email (protonEmail) and opening backdoors that connects the victim computers to ours, in this way you can type commands that will run on the victim PC and more...
> *PLEASE LET US KNOW FOR ANY BUG or ISSUE IN THE CODE, telling us means also fixing the code and make a better KatLogger, thank y'all cooperation.*

# How Does it Work?
> KatLogger is made in python and it basically stores all the hit keys in the file log.txt.
> The code is obliusly open source :), and the main file is "KatLogger_main.py" in the "python" folder, there are also other files but not all of those are really used by KatLogger. These are simply new feature that we'll add in the future...
> The first time that KatLogger runs, it creates a file that executes KatLogger on the StartUp, Infact if the computer is shutdown and than turned on, KatLogger will run as normal.

> # Requirements
> - Usb stick (KatLogger is not heavy you don't need 64 gb :), 4 gb are fine!)
> - Usb AutoRun Creator --> https://usb-autorun-creator.en.softonic.com/
> -  ```python -m pip install pynput smtplib-getpass shutil pyinstaller```
