# KatLogger
> KatLogger is just a simple keylogger coded in python.
> It stores all in the log.txt file that it's created when KatLogger Runs
> The first release "KatLogger_1.0.zip" works only on windows computers, but we're working to make other release that work on both linux or windows, and with more feature like sendind the log.txt file by email (protonEmail)

# How Does it Work?
> KatLogger works thanks to "pynput" library, that can listen for keys to be pressed...
> The code is obliusly open source (It's located in the python folder), it's a simple project that anyone can do, if you're studing or your intrested about python, take a look at the python code located in the "python" folder
# Requirements
> - Usb stick (KatLogger is not heavy you don't need 64 gb :), 4 gb are fine!)
> - Usb AutoRun Creator --> https://usb-autorun-creator.en.softonic.com/
